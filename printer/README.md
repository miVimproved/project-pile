# Printer

Basically a program that prints something to the console over and over again with a delay between characters and a few more settings. I made it when I wanted to print `Why?` to the screen a large number of times, so that's why the file is called `why.c`.

This was directly copied over from it's old location with no changes (as of first commit).
